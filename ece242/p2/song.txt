Wonderful World -a bit modified-
by Sam Cooke

Do not know much about hystori
Do not know much biologi
Do not know much about sience book
Do not know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wanderful world this would be

Do not know much about geographi
Do not know much trigonometri
Do not know much about halgebra
Do not know what a slide rule is for

But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wanderful world this would be

Now, I don't claim to be an A student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an A student, baby
I can win your love for me

La ta ta ta ta ta ta, History
Hmm-mm-mm, Biology
La ta ta ta ta ta ta, Science book
Hmm-mm-mm, French I took
